App Name: Parkinsonar

Short Description:

Parkinsonar is an AWARE-connected (https://awareframework.com/) mobile health Android application for smartphones. It helps detect potential Parkinson's-like symptoms, specifically, resting tremor. Users open the smartphone application a few minutes each day to log their relative hand tremors at rest. The app uses the AWARE framework to incorporate gyroscope sensor input/context to determine the degree of resting tremor a user is experiencing.
